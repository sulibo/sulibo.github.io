# About
I am a senior R&D Engineer at [ALCiDES Robotics](https://www.alcides.tech), working on developing smart mobile robots for efficient material handling.
Before this, I was a senior computer scientist at [Institute of Experimental Psychophysiology - Düsseldorf](https://ixp-duesseldorf.de/), working on developing machine learning based algorithms for affective computing and relevant research software. During 2016-2021, I was a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/groups/NUMA">NUMA (Numerical Analysis and Applied Mathematics) Research unit of Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="http://www.kuleuven.be">KU Leuven</a> and the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/dynamics-and-control/">Dynamics and Control group of Department of Mechanical Engineering</a>, <a href="http://www.tue.nl">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>. Meanwhile, I was also an early stage researcher (ESR 3) in an EU Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN-EJD) project <a href="http://ucocos.cs.kuleuven.be"> UCoCoS</a>. During my PhD, I was working on partial synchronization in networks of delay-coupled systems. The objective was to analyze the robustness and parametric dependence of clusters when delay-coupled networks are paritially synchronized. I obtained my master degree from <a href="http://www.tue.nl">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>, the Netherlands. Before that, I received my bachelor degree from <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn"> Zhejiang Universtiy</a>, China.
