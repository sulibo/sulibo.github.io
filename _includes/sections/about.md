<div>
    I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://twr.cs.kuleuven.be">Scientific Computing Research Group of Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="http://www.kuleuven.be">KU Leuven</a>. Meanwhile, I am also an early stage researcher (ESR 3) in an EU Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN-EJD) project <a href="http://ucocos.cs.kuleuven.be"> UCoCoS</a>. I am working on partial synchronization in delay-coupled networks. The objective
    is to analyze the robustness and parametric dependence of clusters when delay-coupled networks are paritially synchronized. I obtained my master degree from <a href="http://www.tue.nl">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>, the Netherlands. Before that, I received my bachelor degree from <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn"> Zhejiang Universtiy</a>, China.
