This post is a tutorial on solving the Kaggle Titanic Competition using Deep Neural Network with Keras. 

# Introduction 
Kaggle is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. There are many interesting competitions on Kaggle to practice your Data Science skills. The Titanic Competition is usually the first competition you will come across to get familiar with Kaggle setup and test your data science skills.

The goal of the competition is to predict the possibility of survival of the passengers onboard, a typical classification problem. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/sulibo/code_snipets/tree/main/Kaggle/Titanic/Dataset), which contains two CVS's (train.csv and test.csv). The train.csv contains the labelled data to be used for training while the test.csv contains the data for testing your classifier.
