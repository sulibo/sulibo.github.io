title: "Octopress 3 Tutorial"
---
Octopress is a blog toolkit build on top of Jekyll. Using Ocotopress, we can easily build a static blog website from scratch. Recently, Octopress 3.0 has been release on its GitHub page. Ocotpress 3.0 is a full rewrite of Octopress 2. This version is now only a plugin for Jekyll so no division between Octopress and Jekyll. The management is cleaner than the previous versions. However,  the official documents are not complete yet. So I decided to write a tutorial for it, including installation, basic use, deployment to Github page, and also how
to use Octopress from different places. 

# Installing Octopress 

1. Install Ruby 

2. Install git 

3. Install Ocotopress 



# Deploy 

# Use in different places
