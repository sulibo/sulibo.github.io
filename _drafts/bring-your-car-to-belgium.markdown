# Import your car into Belgium

Recently, I have a German car imported into Belgium. For those who would like to do the same, I will put the procedure I went through as a reference. 

We bought the secondhand car from a German dealer and it was registered in Germany since then. To import it, the following steps are needed: 

1. Custom Clearance 

2. Get Belgian insurance 

3. Register in DIV 

4. De-register in Germany

# Custom Clearance 

Since it is a secondhand bought inside EU, there is no pay VAT again. However, it is still required to report to Belgium Dounance office to get the 705 form. Now, the 705 form can be applied via email.
