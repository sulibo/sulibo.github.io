# Personal Blog  

This is my personal blog built by using [Octopress 3](https://github.com/octopress/octopress) and [Leonids](http://renyuanz.github.io/leonids) Jekyll theme. 

Leonids (by [@renyuanz](https://github.com/renyuanz)) is a clean Jekyll theme perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog.

Leonids features a simple resume page (by [@Skn0tt](https://github.com/Skn0tt)), with five sections: 

* Bio (Edit \_data/index/careers.yml)
* Education (Edit \_data/index/education.yml)
* Skills (Edit \_data/index/skills.yml)
* Projects (Edit \_data/index/projects.yml)
* About (Edit \_includes/sections/about.html)
