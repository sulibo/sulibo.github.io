  abstract = {The full synchronization of coupled nonlinear oscillators has been widely studied. In this paper we investigate conditions for which partial synchronization of time-delayed diffusively coupled systems arises. The coupling configuration of the systems is described by a directed graph. As a novel quantitative result we first give necessary and sufficient conditions for the presence of forward invariant sets characterized by partially synchronous motion. These conditions can easily be checked from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Second, we perform stability analysis of the synchronized equilibria in a (gain,delay) parameter space. For this analysis the coupled nonlinear systems are linearized around the synchronized equilibria and then the resulting characteristic function is factorized. By such a factorization, it is shown that the relation between the behaviour of different agents at the zero of the characteristic function depends on the structure of the eigenvectors of the weighted Laplacian matrix. By determining the structure of the solutions in the unstable manifold, combined with the characterization of invariant sets, we predict which partially synchronous regimes occur and estimate the corresponding coupling gain and delay values. We apply the obtained results to networks of coupled Hindmarsh–Rose neurons and verify the occurrence of the expected partially synchronous regimes by using a numerical simulation. We also make a comparison with an existing approach based on Lyapunov functionals.},

  abstract    = {Synchronization is of central importance in power distribution, telecommunication, neuronal, and biological networks. Many networks are observed to produce patterns of synchronized clusters, but it has been difficult to predict these clusters or understand the conditions under which they form, except for in the simplest of networks. In this article, we shed light on the intimate connection between network symmetry and cluster synchronization. We introduce general techniques that use network symmetries to reveal the patterns of synchronized clusters and determine the conditions under which they persist. The connection between symmetry and cluster synchronization is experimentally explored using an electro-optic network. We experimentally observe and theoretically predict a surprising phenomenon in which some clusters lose synchrony while leaving others synchronized. The results could guide the design of new power grid systems or lead to new understanding of the dynamical behavior of networks ranging from neural to social.},

We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the system to reach consensus. Furthermore, we explicitly calculate the dominant characteristic root of the consensus problem as a measure of the speed of convergence. The results show that the anticipatory algorithm can improve the speed of consensus, especially in networks with poor connectivity. Hence, anticipation can improve performance in networks if the delay parameter is chosen judiciously, otherwise the system might diverge as agents try to anticipate too aggressively into the future.},

In case the agents are coupled in a connected and undirected network, the exact condition for consensus is that the delay be less than a constant threshold that is independent of the network topology or size. In directed networks, however, the situation is quite different. We show that the allowable maximum delay for consensus depends on the network topology in a nontrivial way. We study this delay margin in several network constellations, including various circulant networks with directed links. We show that the delay margin depends not only on the number of neighbors, but also on the directionality of connections with those neighbors. Furthermore, the delay margin improves as the circulant networks are rewired en route to a small-world configuration.},

Using a master stability approach, we find that the master stability function shows a discrete rotational symmetry depending on the number of groups. The coupling matrices that permit solutions on group or cluster synchronization manifolds show a very similar symmetry in their eigenvalue spectrum, which helps to simplify the evaluation of the master stability function. Our theory allows for the characterization of stability of different patterns of synchronized dynamics in networks with multiple delay times, multiple coupling functions, but also with multiple kinds of local dynamics in the networks' nodes. We illustrate our results by calculating stability in the example of delay-coupled semiconductor lasers and in a model for neuronal spiking dynamics.},

  abstract = {Networks of weakly nonlinear oscillators are considered with diffusive and time-delayed coupling. Averaging theory is used to determine parameter ranges for which the network experiences amplitude death, whereby oscillations are quenched and the equilibrium solution has a large domain of attraction. The amplitude death is shown to be a common phenomenon, which can be observed regardless of the precise nature of the nonlinearities and under very general coupling conditions. In addition, when the network consists of dissimilar oscillators, there exist parameter values for which only parts of the network are suppressed. Sufficient conditions are derived for total and partial amplitude death in arbitrary network topologies with general nonlinearities, coupling coefficients, and connection delays.},

  abstract = {We consider a linear consensus problem involving a time delay that arises from predicting the future states of agents based on their past history. In case the agents are coupled in a connected and undirected network, the exact condition for consensus is that the delay be less than a constant threshold that is independent of the network topology or size. In directed networks, however, the situation is quite different. We show that the allowable maximum delay for consensus depends on the network topology in a nontrivial way. We study this delay margin in several network constellations, including various circulant networks with directed links. We show that the delay margin depends not only on the number of neighbors, but also on the directionality of connections with those neighbors. Furthermore, the delay margin improves as the circulant networks are rewired en route to a small-world configuration.},

In this paper, we attempt to estimate full/partial synchronization conditions for the Cartesian product networks with time-delay by using the scaling method for synchronization condition and the properties of the Cartesian product. The validity of the estimation method is tested through a numerical example.},
