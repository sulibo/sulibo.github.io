Recently, I have been working on a project that involves simulating robots in the cloud using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Isaac Sim. The goal of the project is to create a platform for testing and training robotic systems in the cloud, without the need for expensive hardware.

In this post, I will show you how to set up the simulation environment (Isaac Sim) and ROS2 on AWS EC2 instances.

## Isaac Sim
Isaac Sim is a simulation software that allows you to create and test robotic systems in a virtual environment.

## Amazon EC2
EC2 is a cloud computing service that provides virtual servers in the cloud. You can use EC2 to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud.
